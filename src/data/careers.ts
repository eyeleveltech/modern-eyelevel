      "Working knowledge of color correction, grading, captions, motion graphics basics, and sound design for short-form",
      "Hands-on experience with AI video tools such as Runway, Veo, Kling AI, Pika, or Luma AI — or a strong willingness to learn fast",
      "Comfortable using AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for scripting, shot planning, and creative research",
      "Solid understanding of platform-specific formats and editing styles for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok",

    qualities: [
      "Sharp eye for pacing and rhythm — you know what makes a reel actually perform",
      "Uses AI as a creative accelerator, not a crutch — quality never takes a back seat to speed",

      "No ego about revisions — you take feedback, iterate fast, and move on",
      "Genuinely curious about where AI and video craft intersect — you experiment because you're interested, not because you were told to",
