    question: "What is a Growth Studio?",
    answer: "A Growth Studio is a modern alternative to a traditional marketing agency. We don't just execute marketing tasks; we partner with you to build a comprehensive growth system that integrates strategy, creative, technology, and performance marketing to achieve your business goals."
  },
  {
    question: "How is EyeLevel different from a marketing agency?",
    answer: "While marketing agencies focus on executing specific services (like SEO or social media), EyeLevel focuses on the entire growth funnel. We start with a deep-dive diagnosis of your business, develop a custom growth strategy, and then execute with a focus on measurable ROI."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of results can I expect?",
    answer: "Our goal is to deliver measurable business growth, not just vanity metrics. Depending on your goals, this could mean more qualified leads, higher conversion rates, increased customer lifetime value, or a stronger brand presence. We set clear KPIs at the beginning of every engagement."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you specialize in?",
    answer: "We have deep expertise in four key verticals: Edu-Marketing, Sports Marketing, Real Estate, and B2B. However, our growth framework is adaptable to any industry where strategic growth is a priority."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to work with EyeLevel?",
    answer: "Our pricing is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each client. We offer a range of engagement models, from project-based fees for strategy work to monthly retainers for ongoing execution. We always start with a free Growth Audit to determine the best approach for you."
